This website displays some of my favourite recipes.
The page will have links to each individual recipe and will use different heading sizes to signify the importance of each piece of text.

Originally I used "./" at the beginning of each href but found that this would not work when the site was deployed on github pages. I found that despite how I thought URLs worked the path I had specified was not in fact correct outside of my local web server.
