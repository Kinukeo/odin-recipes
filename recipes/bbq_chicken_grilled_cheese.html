          4 large or 8 small thick slices of Sourdough, Tiger or Giraffe Bread

        </li>
        <li>2 packed cups / 250g-300g Cooked Chicken, shredded (see notes)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup / 160g BBQ Sauce, or to preference</li>
        <li>4 square slices of Monterey/Pepper Jack Cheese</li>
        <li>4 square slices of Cheddar (or second cheese of choice)</li>
        <li>1/4 - 1/3 cup finely diced Red Onion</li>
        <li>
          1/4 cup Pickled Jalapeños, finely diced (or to spice preference)

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium sized mixing bowl combine chicken, BBQ sauce, jalapeños
          and red onion. Place to one side.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large pan with the heat OFF add two slices of bread. Butter one
          side, then flip so they're butter-side-down. Top with two slices of
          Monterey Jack, half your chicken, followed by two slices of cheddar.
          Add another slice of bread, butter the tops then turn on heat to a
          medium.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry both sides until nice and golden with the cheese melting through
          the centre. If you're making two giant ones be careful when you flip
          or the filling with spill out. Slice in half and enjoy!
