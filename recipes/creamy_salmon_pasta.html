          You can either steam or roast the salmon, depending if you want to
          turn the oven on or not. To roast, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas
          6, place on a baking tray, drizzle with oil and roast for 12 mins
          until opaque and the flesh starts to flake when pressed. To steam,
          place the fillets skin-side down in a steamer, and steam over a pan of
          simmering water for 8-10 mins until cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the salmon is cooking, boil the pasta for 10 mins until al
          dente, then drain, reserving 100ml of the pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil on a medium heat in a wide frying pan and fry the shallot
          for 6 mins until softened, but not turning golden. Add the garlic and
          fry for a minute more until fragrant. Add the wine, bubble for a few
          minutes until reduced by half, then add the cream and season well.
          Bring to a very gentle simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flake the cooked salmon into big chunky pieces, leaving the skin
          behind. Add to the sauce with the cooked pasta. Add the lemon zest, a
          squeeze of the juice and most of the dill. Add a splash of the pasta
          water to the sauce to coat the pasta if you need to. Toss gently to
          keep the salmon in big pieces. Check the seasoning, if using double
          cream you may need a squeeze more lemon juice. Grind over some black
          pepper and scatter over the remaining dill. Serve with a green salad.
